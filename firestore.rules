/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Presell Page Configuration
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for `pageConfigs` located under `/users/{userId}`.
 * All other configurations are stored in top-level collections with open read access but restricted write access.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}/pageConfigs/{pageConfigId}`: Page configurations owned by a specific user.
 * - `/autoRedirectConfigs/{autoRedirectConfigId}`: Configurations for automatic redirection.
 * - `/popupsConfigs/{popupsConfigId}`: Configurations for various pop-ups.
 * - `/cookiePopupConfigs/{cookiePopupConfigId}`: Configurations for cookie pop-ups.
 * - `/ageVerificationPopupConfigs/{ageVerificationPopupConfigId}`: Configurations for age verification pop-ups.
 * - `/discountPopupConfigs/{discountPopupConfigId}`: Configurations for discount pop-ups
